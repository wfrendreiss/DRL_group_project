# DRL_group_project
Our modification of the paper "Multi-game Decision Transformers" by Lee et al. (2022). Our code is taken from the jupyter notebook provided by the authors at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/multi_game_dt, but due to outdated dependencies, we ported it to a python file which is run by a shell file.
